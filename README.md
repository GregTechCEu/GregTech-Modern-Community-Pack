## Playing

The modpack is available on [Curseforge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gregtech-community-pack-modern).

## Building

[packwiz](https://packwiz.infra.link/) will allow you to build either a server or client pack.
Please refer to their tutorials page for more info.

## Server

`serverpack/start.sh` is useful for starting a server on linux, mac or another \*nix flavor. It will also handle procuring the files for you.

`serverpack/start.ps1` is the Powershell 7.4 version and will be the script windows users want to use.
If your system is missing Powershell version 7.4 (or greater) please refer to the installation instructions provided
by Microsoft [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4).
